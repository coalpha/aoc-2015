I decided that I wanted to learn Microsoft OCaml this time.
I pretty much already learned Microsoft Java since I learned Microsoft Basic but
maybe I'll try that for AOC-2016.

You know, I think I'm just barely starting to understand why people like these
types of programming languages so much.
Either that or I'm developing a new type of masochism.
Likely both, now that I think about it.
